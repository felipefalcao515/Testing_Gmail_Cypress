Hi,

I'm Felipe and welcome to my cypress based test project focused on gmail login/register process, this project is intended to be used in Mozilla Firefox. 

Check below how to run each test:

Cypress interface:
1.Open the console and run: npx cypress open

Headless mode:
1.Open the console and run: npx cypress run --browser firefox
